Thoughts on handy Unix-ish utilities...

* There should be a string formatter/tabulator program that is very flexible
and powerful a la Lisp's FORMAT, and has a library that provides the function
that does this.  That way you can use the same syntax for printing stuff from
shell-scripts or from programs, instead of having to re-implement printf* a
bunch.

* Provide the same thing for regexps and sed-ish line-editing.

* And log-files, really...

* And DATES.  As abstract values and concrete strings.

* And time-systems, while you're at it.  Think an API into cron and at.

* See if you can find some simple abstraction for handling mail systems...
things like redirects, away messages, attachments, mailboxes, condensing from
various servers and so on can get really twisted, really fast.  Some concise
layout/option tool would be nice.  See if you can make a unified interface for
mail, and just have programs serve that interface.

* Do the same thing for packages and programs...  keep track of what program
depends on what, and where all it's files are kept.
