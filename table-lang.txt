Table-based programming language

-Like Excel, but awesome.
-Cells can be bounded, typed, etc
-Interactions can be visualized/sorted in different ways
-Cells are named?  Indexed?  Both...
-Cells can contain programs, parameterized functions, references to other
cells
-Cells can be treated as sequences, graphs... inc/dec operators
-Programs can be composed from programs in other cells
-Tables can manipulate each other; ie funcs and var names bound by looking
them up in a certain system table
-Certain cells can have restricted access/permissions?  To, ie, create
abstractions or catch bounds-overflows
-Table references kept in a table!
-Tables can be created or destroyed at runtime...?
-How does abstraction and information hiding work...?  Is there any?

This could actually be really fun to work with...
