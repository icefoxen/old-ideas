Write a self-reproducing program.
Nothing malicious, maybe even something helpful, something trackable, but
something that will spread around.  It will, however, also have a shutoff
switch.

If it were only on Linux/unix, I would have it feed it's source code to a
compiler to reproduce, and put magic numbers in it to help track it.  Probing
and incorperating system info would also be interesting.  Making it exchange
traits with other programs of the same type in a semi-genetic manner would
be cool too.

How will it reproduce or, more properly, distribute itself?  Email itself?
Use worm-ish exploits?  I don't like that...
