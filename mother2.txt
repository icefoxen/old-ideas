MOTHER

A build tool and library management system.  Like findlib/ocamlfind, except
using plugins for different languages.

...now, there are two parts... library indexing, which is basically ocamlfind,
and source management, which is more like make --automatic building according
to various rules.  It does not generate the configuration for a certain
platform, but retains it...  It knows all the stuff about the system, so you
don't have to use a configure script or makefile hacking to find out the
needed info.

Library indexing is just putting all the libraries somewhere, keeping track of
them, and feeding them to the linker appropriately.  It also hangs on to
metadata such as name, version, dependancies, source location, license, and so
on.

Source management is keeping track of all the source files in a library,
keeping track of what other libraries and so on are used, keeping track of
build order and such, keeping track of system information such as processor
and graphics and compiler versions and so on, then deciding how the thing
should be compiled.

Maybe I should just call this Keeptracker, instead...  ^_~


Should probably write it in Python or MAYBE Lisp.  With Lisp we have the
system interface to worry about though, which is annoying.

Design the system, figure out where it keeps everything and how it organizes
things first.  PLUGINS, simple universally-applicable data that can be input
and output in consistant ways.
