A program for generating haiku.  Pretty simple right, just choose three lines
at random from appropriate dictionaries.

Now...  What if you try to have it make GOOD haiku?  Like, each line is
weighted on suitability compared to what other lines have been chosen?  Some
sorta Bayesian-ish learning algorithm might be done, but it'd take a heyoooge
database for it to really start to be effective.  Still, 'tis a neat idea.
