I wrote a tiny ant-hill simulator many years ago when I learned pascal
programming in high school. Create two ant-hills, drop several hundred ants in
them, make 'em lay pheromone trails and give em four simple rules... or
something like that. And you get beautiful emergent behaviour.

If you want the binary and/or source, I'd be glad to send it. Drop me a line.

Just reread the paragraph above. Let me do a quick summary of the rules I used
as far as I can recall them.

    * Ant does a little random walk, in a way that prevents it from staying
    * close to its starting point for too long.
    * If ant is looking for food and finds food, take food home and leave
    * trail.
    * If ant is looking for food and finds trail, follow trail.
    * If ant reaches end of trail, engage in a spiral search pattern for a
    * short time.
    * If and carries food and reaches nest, drop food and start searching
    * again.

Tadaa, you get very realistic looking ant-trails and a population proportional
to the distance of food from the next. (It might be interesting to graph what
kind of proportionality.)

Oh, and ants have a limited lifespan, and as food is collected, new ants get
born for each number of food units. That's about it... it sure looks cool. I
used to watch my ants for hours during my 'O' level classes. ;)
