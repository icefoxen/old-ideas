Computers are very good at following orders, of course.  They are very good at
searching for things and recording things and recognizing patterns.  But they
can't /understand/ things.
Example.  I thought it may be cool to write a program that automatically
indexes my internet bookmarks for me, since they are getting rather out of
hand.  It just has to grab each one and figure out which category it should
belong in.  Easy, ne?  Well.  It can get the list of all the websites, yes,
and it can store and retrieve the list, yes, and it can build up and organize
and retrieve the tree of categories.  But how can it know which site should go
in which category??  Simplest solution is to have me just tell it, but then
what's the point of having a program in the first place??
...Actually, this may be possible, especially in Prolog.  It won't be able to
make choices, exactly, but it may be able to make, in effect, an educated
guess.  'Twon't be easy though.  Zeroth, make sets for all categories.  First,
grab the site.  Second, parse it and search for certain key words and
phrases that get mentioned X or more times.  Third, stick the site in the
appropriate sets.  Fourth, let the human edit.
