Build a bot, a remote-control worm.  Hey, have it grab it's instructions
automatically at some interval from a website.  It should NOT be too virilant;
having it clog up networks is a bad idea.
Perhaps two versions, a worm that distributes itself, and an email trojan?
Spam is a big enough problem, but it DOES get attachments clicked on...
No.  I am NOT going to become a spammer, even for a good cause.

What it should do upon infecting a computer:
Download and install Windows Updates
Install a firewall and configure it well
Download and install Firefox; if possible, replace the IE icons with links to
Firefox.
Install a tutorial on basic computer security, and pop it up at boot-time with
a message along the lines of "Your computer has been infected!  Fortunately,
it's not a malicious one.  Read on to find out how to keep this from happening
more nastily."
If possible, replace Outlook Express and copy mailboxes over...
Install Ad-Aware, Spybot, or similar things.
Spread itself silently and politely.  Perhaps it'll watch the network and if
it sees a lot of traffic from other Happybots it won't replicate (or at least
delay it).  Throttling, basically.  Don't use more than X kbps of bandwidth at
any one time.
Record and deliver basic logging information: Windows version, ip/MAC address
information for statistics purpose, bandwidth avaliable (broadband or dialup),
perhaps the existance of other firewalls, virus-scanners, or
worms/trojans/etc.
Delete itself after a certain amount of time and ensure (through the security
measures taken) that the computer won't be re-infected by it.  If it has to
leave behind some magic marker showing that it's been there so other copies of
it won't infect the computer, it hasn't done a good enough job.
