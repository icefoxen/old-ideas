
So this is a system interface.  It does networking, it does proxying, it does program management and automation.  It does user-interface via network either with a special client, or regular telnet.

So, parts:
Filesystem library
Stackshell & script interperater
File transfer stuff
Automation
Program interface
Compiler access
Chat and internet access


Things that are cool:
Chatservers
MU*'s
Fora
Databases
Mail servers
Portscanners
XML
GUI's
Customizable/Theme-able GUI's
Embedded interperaters --a la Emacs and Script-Fu
Remote-access anything
Portability (as in, you can access it from anywhere.  ^_^)
Lisp- and Forth-like languages
Automation/cron
AI/neural nets/genetic algorithms
Postscript
TeX
Set-based FS (duh)
Proxies
Dynamic linking/modules
Stackshell


A hacked mail server/client that responds to any message, IE SPAM, with a virus and/or excessively large attachment
