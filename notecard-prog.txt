What it sounds like... a program that lets you put together, file, index,
organize, cross-reference, and otherwise fool around with a bunch of
note-cards-like objects.  They can have text, images, reference to other
cards, anything.

A little like webpages, a little like Hypercard, a little like Powerpoint, a
little like a word-processor.
It's a tool for organizing IDEAS.
