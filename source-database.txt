A source database and make tool, all cross-referenced, all storing each
function or method or object on it's own.  Automatically computes
dependancies, support for seperate projects and libraries and so on, indices
compiled binaries (?), very smalltalk-ish or LispM-ish.  Either implement it
on Emacs, or use Emacs as a front-end!
Leave support for other plug-in editors though!




Database source-tool.  It should have the revision control built in, or
options for revision control.

I still dislike the non-plain-textiness of it.  Even though it leads to
syntax-independance.  Perhaps a good idea is this: instead of storing
everything in the database, store the actual source as a plain text file, then
store all the metadata in a database.  That might work well, in terms of
failure-safety.
