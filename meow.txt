A UI experiment.  Look up the Canon Cat on google to see what I mean, then
write a program similar to it.  Shouldn't be too hard to get the basics
done...


Issues: Non-texty data.  GKrellm gives a good example; a page just updating
that?  What about playing MP3's?  Basically it turns into using text as a
universal interface-tool, and not necessarily a good one...
Organizing a lot of data.  How do I keep my 185 megs of miscellanious source
code organized?  What about object code and executables; there's no real
equivilant, how does it work?

Basically, it's just fine as long as all you do is a lot of writing...
