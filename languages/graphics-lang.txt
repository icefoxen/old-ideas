It would be nice if we had some universal language for drawing/representing
graphics, perhaps something like PS...  Basically, it'd be a manipulation
language and a specification language in one...
Okay, okay, all I'm really after is a simple way to draw a UI on a remote
system, hopefully something simple and lightweight but flexible and consistant
and extensible.  NOT X!!!
