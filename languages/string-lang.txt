Just an idea.  Make a string-processing command language.  Think Awk, Sed,
Perl, regexps, Icon...

The problem is, it can be simple like Sed or Awk, and limitedly useful, or it
can be complex like Perl and Icon, and confusing as hell.


In general though, this is a field that already has a lot of useful tools, so
it's not a huge priority.  Just something to ponder now and then.
